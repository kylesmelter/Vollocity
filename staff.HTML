    <h1>Kelsey Brandl</h1>
    <p>To say Kelsey knows the sport would be an understatement.
        She began her volleyball career at the age of nine playing for a club
        team at Minnesota Nothern Lights. After two years she joined a club team 
        at Minnesota One (M1) Volleyball. It was during these years she laid the
        foundation for one of the most successful prep volleyball careers in 
        the state of Minnesota.

        Playing for Lakeville North, she lettered all four years as a middle-hitter, 
        and led her to team to a school-record 30 wins (30-2) during her 
        senior season, and topped the year off with a third-place finish in the 
        3A State Finals. Her prep play earned her a slew of accolades over the years, 
        including:

        <ul>
            <li>2007 Tribune Metro Player of the Year</li>
            <li>Ranked the No. 25 senior in the country according to prepvolleyball.com</li>
            <li>Three-time all-conference and all-state selection</li>
            <li>Member of the U.S. Girls' Youth National Team</li>
        </ul>

        After gradauting from high school, she went on to play one year at the 
        University of Cincinnati before transferring and finishing her college 
        career playing three years at Ball State University in Indiana. During her
        time at Ball State, she earned First-team All-MAC honors each of her three
        years, and still ranks third in program history with a .340 career hitting
        percentage.

        Outside of her career as a player, she also has a wealth of experience in
        coaching. The breadth of her coaching spans the spectrum—including developmetals
        in players age 10 and younger all the way up to collegiate level, including
        stints at St. Olaf College and Hamline University as an assistant coach.

        But when she's not on the court, her passion for educating extends beyond
        the sport and into her career as a nurse and clinical resource specialist.
        She also enjoys spending time outdoors and hiking the endless amount of trails
        the Pacific Northwest has to offer, as well as hanging out with her two cats,
        Sierra and Sequoia.
